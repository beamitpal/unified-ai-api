## Why no imports?
To simplify development, like `Notification` or `fetch`, reducing setup complexity.

## How do users manage models?
Via a system app (e.g., Settings > AI) to select models (e.g., Gemini, Apple Intelligence) and configure privacy.

## How is privacy handled?
On-device processing for sensitive data, encrypted cloud fallback, and user permissions.
