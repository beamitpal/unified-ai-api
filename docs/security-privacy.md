# Security and Privacy

## Overview
The Unified AI API prioritizes user privacy and security for AI-driven tasks.

## Principles
- **On-Device Processing**: Sensitive data processed locally (e.g., Gemini Nano, Apple Intelligence).
- **Cloud Fallback**: Encrypted connections (TLS 1.3) for cloud-based AI.
- **Permissions**: `AI.requestPermission(task)` for sensitive operations.
- **Model Validation**: Sandboxed custom model loading to prevent malicious code.
- **Compliance**: GDPR, CCPA, platform-specific privacy policies.

## Implementation
- Encryption: AES-256 for data at rest, TLS for transit.
- Sandboxing: Platform-specific (e.g., AppSandbox for iOS, SELinux for Android).
- Audits: SOC2/ISO27001 compliance for cloud components.

## User Controls
- System app toggles for on-device vs. cloud processing.
- App-specific permissions (e.g., restrict AI access to Messages).
