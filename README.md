# Unified AI API Proposal

A proposal for a native, system-level **Unified AI API** across web, Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, Linux, and other platforms. The `AI` API provides no-import-required access to AI capabilities (e.g., text generation, image analysis, smart notifications), similar to the Web Notifications API (`Notification`). A system app lets users select AI models (e.g., Gemini, Apple Intelligence) and configure privacy/performance.

## Goals
- **Native Integration**: Global `AI` API in each platform‚Äôs runtime, no imports needed.
- **Unified Interface**: Consistent methods and data formats across platforms.
- **User Control**: System app for model selection and privacy settings.
- **System Features**: Seamless integration with notifications and other native APIs.
- **Privacy/Security**: On-device processing, GDPR/CCPA compliance.

## Repository Structure
- **docs/**: Detailed proposal, API spec, platform implementations, and more.
- **examples/**: Code samples for web, Android, iOS, Windows, Linux.
- **mockups/**: UI designs for the AI Settings app.
- **ISSUE_TEMPLATE/**: Templates for bugs, features, and platform feedback.
